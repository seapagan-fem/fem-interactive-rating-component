## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was good fun to do. It would have been trivial in React however I chose
vanilla JS since I'm not too strong in that to be honest. I'd appreciate
suggestions how to streamline the Javascript, though I am reasonably chuffed
with it!

The styling was pretty straight forward tbh.

### Continued development

I'd like to come back later and add some transitions or animations when the vote
and submit buttons are pressed.
